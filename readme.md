> Project Tech is a first stepping stone for you to become a well-rounded web developer (or a designer with knowledge of how things are made). You'll build a dynamic prototype of a web application. This project continues where earlier courses left off with topics such as HTML, CSS, JS, research, design, and project management.

## Run locally

Before you can run this project locally [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) must be installed

Clone this project & Install the dependencies:
```zsh
  $ git clone https://github.com/GiovanniDw/party-finder.git  
  $ cd party-finder
  $ npm install
```

Before the app can be started, we need to create a `.env` file in the root folder of the app. This file must have some env variables specified below.
   - `MONGO_DB` - Must be a connection string of mongoDB. I recommend a free MongoDB at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
   - `DB_NAME` - Must be the name of your mongoDB.
   - `PORT` - The port the server wil run at localhost.
   - `SESSION_SECRED` - For more info check[https://github.com/expressjs/session#secret](https://github.com/expressjs/session#secret)
   - `API_KEY` - To use the search for games function you can get a free API key at [https://api.igdb.com](https://api.igdb.com) 


The `.env` file could look something like this: 

```
MONGO_DB=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<context>-xxxxxx.mongodb.net/test
DB_NAME=< The name of your mongoDB >
PORT="XXXX"
SESSION_SECRED='xxxxxxx'
API_KEY='xxxxxxxxx'
```

Start the app:
```zsh
$ npm run start
```
Start the app with nodemon:
```zsh
$ npm run nmStart
```
