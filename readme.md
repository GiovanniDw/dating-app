## Description

This repo is a project based on the following course at HvA CMD
- [Block Tech](https://github.com/cmda-bt)
   - [Project Tech](https://github.com/cmda-bt/pt-course-19-20)

> Project Tech is a first stepping stone for you to become a well-rounded web developer (or a designer with knowledge of how things are made). You'll build a dynamic prototype of a web application. This project continues where earlier courses left off with topics such as HTML, CSS, JS, research, design, and project management.

> We‚Äôll focus on what it means to be a web dev, the current landscape of that space, and topics such as privacy, security, diversity, inclusion, accessibility, communication and team work.

> You‚Äôll learn about those ‚Äúsofter‚Äù skills and ‚Äúharder‚Äù essentials such as how to use the command line, a text editor, version control, build tools, and code quality.
